title: "Analysis of Reef Fish and Invertebrate Assemblage Structure on High and Low Human Impact Hawiian Coral Reefs"
output: html_document
---
# Authors: James Sturges & Tari Lopez 
# Last Modified: 1 December 2022

# README
This script analyzes data of Hawaiian coral reef metrics from 5 different sites on the big island of Hawaii. These data were compiled by Dr. Jason Smith and Dr. Jeremy Claisse and were the result of ongoing student-lead sampling effort. James Sturges was a member of the 2019 class and 2022 sampling team.

#### Packages ----

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(vegan)
```

```{r}
#### Site Metadata ----
# 5 sites (3 high impact 2 low impact)
# All sites are located on the dry side of the Big Island
# Kahaluu is the only site with a high and low impact site adjacent to each other

```

```{r}
##### Fish Metadata ----

# metadata includes 3 name types (Common, Latin, and Hawaiian) 
# also includes diet categories (Herbivore, Ominvore, and Predator) 
# Note that not all fish have a Hawaiian name so there are NAs
fish_meta <- read_excel("Coral_Reef_Data_2014_2018.xlsx", "Fish Metadata")

```

```{r}
#### Fish Community Data ----

#Creates fish df in wide format

# Removes spp. Manybar Goatfish
# Was not analyzed prior to 2022 sampling year

# joins metadata for spp name and dietary startegy

### Substrate and Coral Coverage Data ----
